                <h2>Website Purpose</h2>
                <p>The purpose of the website Converts of London is to bring people together
                    by sharing their conversion stories. This site is specifically catered
                    to those converts who are currently living in London.</p>

                <h2>Audience</h2>
                <p>The audience for Converts of London would be a member of the LDS church,
                    specifically to those who reside in the United Kingdom, but not limited to
                    them. Anyone who is a member of the church could find joy through this site.
                    People who use this site would be aged 16 to 45. </p>

                <h2>Personas</h2>

                <p>James is a 25 year old man who has recently returned home from
                    serving a mission in Germany. He is originally from England, and after
                    serving a mission, he is interested to know about the missionary efforts
                    taking place in his home country. He would use this site to share these
                    stories with his friends or other investigators.</p>

                <p>Leann Campbell is a 37 year old woman who has only heard negative things
                    about the LDS church. She has a few friends who are LDS, but she is always
                    to afraid to ask them about their religion. She would use this site to learn
                    about the LDS faith, and discover what kind of people belong to this church.

                    <h2>Location</h2>
                    <p>There will be one primary navigation bar located across the top of webpage directly underneath the logo. It will be center aligned with numerous links to click on that will take you to other pages on the website. The pages will be as follows: Home, About, Media, Learn, and Contact.</p>
                    <h2>Size</h2>
                    <p>The nav bar will be the same width as the banner with the logo that it is placed beneath, but the height will be much smaller, about 25px in height.</p>
                    <h2>Effects</h2>
                    <p>When the computer cursor is hovering over the link, the color of the link will change. Iâ€™m not sure if I want the background to change color or the text to change color, but there will be contrast to further indicate this page is a link.</p>
